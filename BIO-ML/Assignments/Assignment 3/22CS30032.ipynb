The tasks are:\n","\n","1. Construct a decision tree using the **Gini impurity** criterion.\n","2. Fit the model to the dataset and evaluate its performance by plotting validation loss and accuracy, varying the number of epochs (iterations) from 1 to 20.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","This dataset was sourced from the SEER Program's November 2017 update, which provides population-based cancer statistics. It includes data on female patients diagnosed with **infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma** of the breast (histology codes 8522/3) between **2006 and 2010**.\n","\n","### Input Variables\n","The dataset contains the following features:\n","\n","1. **Age**: Patient's age.\n","2. **Race**: Patient's race (e.g., American Indian/AK Native, Asian/Pacific Islander).\n","3. **Marital Status**: Marital status of the patient.\n","4. **T Stage**: AJCC 6th T stage classification for the tumor.\n","5. **N Stage**: AJCC 6th N stage classification for regional lymph nodes.\n","6. **6th Stage**: Breast cancer AJCC 6th stage classification.\n","7. **Differentiate**: Degree of differentiation of the tumor.\n","8. **Grade**: Tumor grade, indicating its aggressiveness.\n","9. **A Stage**:\n","   - **Regional**: Neoplasm that has extended.\n","   - **Distant**: Neoplasm that has metastasized to distant body parts.\n","10. **Tumor Size**: Tumor size in millimeters.\n","11. **Estrogen Status**: Status of estrogen receptors in the tumor.\n","12. **Progesterone Status**: Status of progesterone receptors in the tumor.\n","13. **Regional Node Examined**: Number of regional lymph nodes examined.\n","14. **Regional Node Positive**: Number of regional lymph nodes positive for cancer.\n","15. **Survival Months**: Number of months the patient survived after diagnosis.\n","\n","### Output Variable\n","- **Status**: Survival status of the patient (`Alive` or `Dead`).\n","\n","## Methodology\n","\n","1. **Decision Tree Construction**: We will use the **Gini impurity** method for splitting nodes.\n","2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:\n","   - The decision tree will be trained on the dataset.\n","   - We will monitor **validation loss** and **accuracy** while varying the number of epochs from **1 to 20**.\n","   - Plots of accuracy and validation loss over epochs will be generated to assess the modelâ€™s performance.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib\n","! pip install pandas numpy seaborn
